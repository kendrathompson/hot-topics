				<h2 class="col">The Value of Money</h2>
				<figure>
					<img class="img-fluid" src="images/suitcase.png">
					<p>Money can have an effect on people in many different ways. For example, some people find that money is valuable based on the happiness from the material posessions it can buy, and for some, money can be valuable in the sense that it is desired and difficult to attain. A person's relationship with money is usually dependant on what job they have, their social class, and their personality. If someone is rich and can live extravagantly without worry, they are more likely to have a positive relationship with money and see it as a reliable and constant aspect of their life. If someone is in between jobs, struggling with student dept, and living with required expenses that cause stress in their daily life, they are more likely to have a tenuous relationship with money. <br>This is the norm for what we expect, if you are rich people assume you have a beautiful relationship with money, and if you are poor people assume you have an ugly relationship with money; however, that is not always the case. Some people who are rich can have a bad relationship with money if they forget to pay taxes and get thrown in jail for tax fraud. That is the extreme, but a more common occurance when you're rich is that people will take advantage of you. If you can't tell who your true friends are because they only want you for your money, it is likely that you will have a bittersweet relationship with your riches. Being wealthy also puts you at a greater risk of theft, being robbed, being attacked, or a victim of fraud.

				<figure>
					<img class="img-fluid" src="images/corn.png">
					<p>There are many conversations about Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) these days. Some people are very against GMOs, while some people don't mind or even know what it is. What GMO means is that a genetic material in a food product has been engineered and altered/modified. GMO is so popular because it makes food products be lower prices which benefits both customers and the businesses buying stock from suppliers. A popular GMO is a toxin that kills insects, but is safe for human consumption. The opinions about this are mixed, as some people do not believe it is truly safe or ethical for humans to produce and consume foods that are covered in insecticide. Many of these GM foods are modified to defend diseases in plants and make the produce last longer, which is also a money saver for all involved. <br>Another big concern about GM foods is that the insecticides used will kill harmless bugs, honey bees for example, which is unintended but a real concern for many. Ethically, many people are against GMOs as they bring chemicals into nature. But no human harm has occured from these chemicals used in GMO foods as of yet. </p>

				<h2 class="col">The View of the World in 2100</h2>
				<figure>
					<img class="img-fluid" src="images/earth.png">
					<p>Imagine it is the year 2100, the weather is most likely much more expreme, there have no doubt been many more disastrous world storms and diseases, perhaps even a war, and the earth is most likely dying at a rapid pace if not already a block of coal. At the rate we are going on Earth, we are basically shit out of luck for the year 2100. <br>OR perhaps we turned the effects of global warming around in the next few years and the year 2100 is filled with organized recycling, clean air, and a lack of polution and litter. We still have some hope left if we elect the right people to power who believe in and will fight for clean energy and promote knowledge and funding of ecofriendly environmental changes. <br>Something else millenials are considering about life in the future is whether or not to procreate. Many people aware of the state of the Earth and its future are worried to have children and make them inherit a hopeless planet. However the counter argument to that is that if we fight for change, our children can continue this fight and hopefully succeed when we are gone. If we raise children to be intelligent and aware of their surroundings, we will hopefully bring on a generation of change for the better.</p>
